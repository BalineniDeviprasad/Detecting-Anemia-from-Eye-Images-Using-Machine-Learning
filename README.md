In many parts of the world, anemia is detected by using invasive laboratory techniques that
require the extraction of blood by certified biomedical scientists or licensed laboratory
technicians. It is very risky at the time of pregnancy and in ICU sometimes causing death.So,
it is a need of hemoglobin and detects anemia quickly. Usually, doctors examine the eye
conjunctiva color and confirmed by a blood test which is painful, time-consuming and costly.So,
the images are captured and trained. By using the images, the percentage of the red, greenand
blue pixels are extracted and used to predict the output by using machine learning.

Classification
➢ In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a
set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set
of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.
➢ CNN: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of Machine learning algorithm
specifically designed for image processing and recognition tasks. The CNN algorithm is
especially useful for image recognition, image classification and Computer vision tasks
because they can process large amounts of data and produce highly accurate predictions.So,
in the proposed implementation for CNN the activation functions are relu and softmax. The
training and testing has been set to the 70 and 30 and the number of epochs used 10.
➢ Decision Tree Algorithm: Decision Tree algorithms are used for both predictions as well
as classification in machine learning. Using the decision tree with a given setof inputs, one
can map the various outcomes that are a result of the decisions.
➢ Random Forest Algorithm: Random Forest classifiers are a type of ensemble learning
method that is used for classification that can be performed with the help of the decision
trees. These decision trees can be constructed at the training time and the output of the class
can be classification.
